            <h1>The Story of Us</h1>
            <p>We at Candy and Lacy want to welcome you to our digital home. Each product on this site was made by the loving hands of a skilled artisan working from home. We believe in allowing our passion to set us free from the every day 9-5.
            </p>

            <p>From the website to each carefully crafted and curated custom piece each artisan has joined Candy and Lacy with a singular purpose. To let our passion for creativity and storytelling brighten the lives of those around us.</p>


            <p>Whether it is custom beadwork by Candy, custom characters by Lacy or the custom website each element comes with its own story.</p>

            <p>Candy and Lacy started as a way to fight back against the darkness of daily life in the pandemic and ignited imaginations and passions alike. We welcome you to walk in our world. Perhaps you will find your own story here.
